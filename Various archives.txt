1) calculation on client side in form: not necessary, seems long to implement
=> to see calculation result, user will have to save and open in Display mode

teaFields.js, displayFields:

  {
    dbFieldName: "pricePerGram", //not a DB field, client calulates value
    displayLabel: "Price / gram ($)",
    displayOrder: 10,
    type: "calculation",
    data: "lastpurchasepriceinusdcents/(100*weightingrams)",
    parent: "",
    defaultValue: "",
    mandatory: false
  },

Utils.js, comments:

Special behaviour to implement on client side for specific types:
- "calculation": calculated by client according to formula provided in "data",
  do not send back to server
