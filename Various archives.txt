calculation on client side in form: not necessary, seems long to implement
=> to see calculation result, user will have to save and open in Display mode

teaFields.js, displayFields:

  {
    dbFieldName: "pricepergram", //not a DB field, client calulates value
    displayLabel: "Price / gram ($)",
    displayOrder: 10,
    type: "calculation",
    data: "lastpurchasepriceinusdcents/(100*weightingrams)",
    parent: "",
    defaultValue: "",
    mandatory: false
  },

Utils.js, comments:

Special behaviour to implement on client side for specific types:
- "calculation": calculated by client according to formula provided in "data",
  do not send back to server

utils.js deleted, backup: 
"use strict";

/* 
In the client, the behaviour of a few fields will be harcoded, 
but for other fields, the client will create components dynamically using 
objects in xxxFields.js
*/
/*
objects format:
{
    dbFieldName = field name in DB query result (must be lower case)
    displayLabel = label to use in client ("hidden" if not displayed)
    displayOrder = display order for fields that are not harcoded in client 
    type = data type, like 'integer' or 'date' - see also special types below
    data = external data source (edit mode: dropdown list, display mode: url)
    parent = edit mode only, allow to filter when needed
    default value = edit mode only, prefill empty values
    mandatory = edit mode only, perform check when user submit 
    readonly = edit mode only, not modifiable
}
*/
/* 
Special behaviour to implement on client side for specific types:
- "PK" = primary key, not displayed
- "FK" = foreign key, creates a dropdown list for resource "data", 
  filtered by resource "parent" (optional)
- "currency": stored as an integer but displayed with 2 decimals
  (for baht, we'll use integer as baht cents don't matter much)
- "weight": if > 1000, convert to kilograms (and display unit accordingly)
- "url": to display the fuild, we need to combine 2 entries from server: 
  one with the text of the url and one with the url itself
